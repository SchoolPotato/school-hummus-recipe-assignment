        <h1>Quick Hummus Recipe</h1>
        <hr>
        <p style="font-size: 120%;">
            This recipe makes quick, tasty hummus, with no messing. It has been adapted from a number
            of different recipes that I have read over the years.
            Hummus is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle Eastern dishes. It is very
            tasty with salad, grilled meats and pitta breads.

        <ol>
            <li style="font-size: 120%">
                Remove the skin from the garlic and chop coarsely

            </li>
            <li style="font-size: 120%">
                Add all the ingredients into a food processor

                If you want a coarse "chunky" hummus, process it for a short time
                If you want a smooth hummus, process it for a longer time
            </li>
        </ol>
        <br><br>
        <p style="font-size: 120%">For a different flavour, you could try blending in a small measure of lemon and coriander, chili
            pepper, lime and chipotle, harissa and mint, or spinach and feta cheese. Experiment and see
            what works for you.

        <h3>Storage</h3>
        <hr>
        <p style="font-size: 120%">
            Refrigerate the finished hummus in a sealed container. You should be able to use it for about a
            week after you've made it. If it starts to become fizzy, you should definitely discard it.
            Hummus is suitable for freezing; you should thaw it and use it within a couple of months.
